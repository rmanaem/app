# Notes

AI buffer:

- implement inline changing of reps, weight, and rpe
- implement functionality for swap and delete buttons


Update the RPE target on exercise tuner sheet to use the same scroller we have on onboarding goal configuration page.

make sure exercise cards show no leading zeros for exercise sets, numbers, rpe


the program button should take the user to a screen where they can see existing programs they created, what's available to them to pick from the existing program templates (provided for free and pre-configured) and to be able to create a program. the screen should also allow them to pick a program to set for the training tab to run. 

dragging the cards to reorder exercises on workout editor page


We need a Dedicated Weight Screen?

    The Pattern: The Dashboard is for Status. Clicking a card should take you to Details.

    The Destination: Create a WeightHistoryPage. It should show a big interactive chart (Zoomable/Pannable) and a list of logs below it.

    Design: Follow the "Mission Manifest" aesthetic—floating graph, clean list. Do not copy the reference (screenshot 2) exactly; it looks too "medical/soft." Keep it "Obsidian."

    maybe it should be one of the tabs and the logic for setting would be moved to a cog at teh top right of dashboard?




Unify components that are repeated to use the same atom like the ticker.

Files need to be renamed e.g., pages -> screens, app shell page -> app shell

Address hard coded tokens

the confirm buttons should be spaced from teh button equally on all screens right now they're not see confirming activity level or height cmpared to confirming the overall stats page.


add sf pro rounded fonts from apple dev thingy

see if we can make it so the tactile_ruler_picker has custom ticks e.g., for time every big tick is a minute and you can increment by 10 a step

verify user perference for units is propogtated appropriately and consistently throughout the app
