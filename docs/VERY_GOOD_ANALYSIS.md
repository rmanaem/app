# Very good analysis


## rules to respect

- Do not provide the default value for an argument as it is redundant
- Use 'package:' imports for files in the 'lib' directory
- Sort directive sections alphabetically
- A value for optional parameter must be given 
- Do not use unnecessary multiple underscores
- To-do comment must follow the Flutter style 
- Always include documentation for a public member
